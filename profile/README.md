This Sheffield Centre for Machine Intelligence Community organisation was created with partial support from the [Turing Network Development Award](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/uk-universities-receive-first-ever-turing-network-development-awards) by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). It aims to show case data science and AI software developed at Sheffield and our network.
